The Military Veterans Pension Payroll Institute (MVPPI) is a government funded organization (hypothetical) and is a subsidiary to the Military Officers Payroll Institute (MOPI), maintains paperwork containing all the payroll information of Ex-Servicemen/Women. Their job is to ensure timely delivery of the pension and other allowances to the veterans or their nominees (For Martyrs).
The MOPI and the MVPPI act as separate entities. For an organization like the MVPPI it is imperative to have a dynamic, well connected and electronic payroll data base. As the MOPI data bases and the MVPPI are not linked, the officers once retiring have to enroll themselves for the pension scheme. The system in place has a sense of ambiguity attached as clerical errors are bound to happen when accounts are handled manually. Handling confidential (SSN and Bank details) data about the nation’s veterans should be done securely. The current paper-based system is totally insecure and calls for a digital framework with encryptions. The current process a veteran must undertake to change banking and personal details, would take weeks to be processed. Most veterans and their families would not be able to undergo this ordeal every time they request a change. 
The payroll system should be dynamic and be able to account for changes in costs of living and lifestyle. This would not be possible if on a monthly basis, tons of paperwork need to be processed.
Main functions considered in the proposed system will be:

1)	A digital framework will be created. All the paperwork will be digitalized.

2)	The details of a serviceman once retired /Dead/Martyred would be updated to the MVPPI data base from the MOPI data base by the HR department. The MOPI contains information about all current servicemen. The MVPPI has veteran/ex-servicemen details.

3)	The HR department and the Accounts department of the MVPPI will be connected. The Accounts department is responsible for the following:

    I.	Accessing veteran details from the MVPPI data base
    II.	Accessing and calculating the pension and allowance Slabs 
    III.	Evaluating Nominee details
    IV.	Evaluating Bank details 
    V.	Creating monthly Pay Slips
    VI.	Ensuring timely disbursal of the pension to the rightful veteran or his/her nominee
    
4)	Inter organization data base access: The government’s finance office updates the pension and the allowance slabs. The MVPPI’s accounts dept does not have write access to these two data sets.

5)	The MOPI acts as the bridge between the veterans and the MVPPI to enable users to request changes. The user has to log in to his account with the MOPI / or reach out to the nearest MOPI office to request changes.

6)	The MOPI has access to the MVPPI data base and will be able to make any changes in the personal details when requested by a veteran or their nominees.

7)	The veterans: They can request any changes only to the following tables(online)
    •	Nominees
    •	Bank details
    •	PaySlip (View access only. Limited to the user’s account)
    
8)	Encrypting confidential information and ensuring data security (Not Included)
